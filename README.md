### Hi there! 😁

My name is Luiz Fernando Estivalet from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Full Stack Developer since 2000 and also an experienced test lead working with Robot Framework. I'm passionate about open source projects, and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play piano, develop some games, to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵).

Would you like to find me?
